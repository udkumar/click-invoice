Click Invoices is a very simple Ruby on Rails invoicing application, built using the amazing [active_admin][1] gem.

# I am making Awesome invoice with the help of good team.

# iphone/ Android App will be available....

# You're going to need to create a user on the database using irb:

#rails console
#>> AdminUser.create! :email => "uday@dolpine.in", :password => "12345678", :password_confirmation => "12345678", :admin => true


#You'll need to generate the assets for Active_admin:
#rails g active_admin:assets
